## 📦 VSCode and Python Extension

### 1) Install VSCode
> Firstly, we need to download Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. Go to the website: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download For the video about downloading: https://youtu.be/Dnw27nTX66o?t=22

</p>

### 2) Install Python 3.11
> Secondly, we need to download Python. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. We download it to use this software language on our device. Go to the website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## 🐱‍👤 First Lines

### 1) <code>print</code>
> Uses to output to the screen. Usage:

```
print("Can you hear me?")
```
> This will write <i>Can you hear me?</i> to the terminal

### 2) <code>input</code>
> It allows us to use it in the program by entering data from the terminal

```
input("Write your name: ")
```
> This will write <i>Write your name: </i> and will wait until you write anything

### 3) <code>if</code>
> It allows us to create condition block

```
if 5 > 2:
  print("This is true!")
```
> This will write <i>This is true!</i> because <i>if</i> condition is right (As we know, 5 is bigger than 2). So how do we do it if it's wrong?

### 4) <code>if-else</code>
> It allows us to create condition block

```
if 2 > 5:
  print("This is true!")
else:
  print("This isn't true!")
```
> This will write <i>This isn't true!</i> because <i>if</i> condition isn't right (As we know, 2 isn't bigger than 5). So how do we do it if it's equal?

### 5) <code>if-elif-else</code>
> It allows us to create condition block with different possibilities

```
if 2 > 2:
  print("This is true!")
elif 2 == 2:
  print("They are equal")
else:
  print("This isn't true!")
```
> This will write <i>They are equal</i> because <i>if</i> condition isn't right and <i>elif</i> is right. (As we know, 2 equal 2 😁). So how do we do cheack them? For example we used "==" in our "elif" section. Before talk about them, I need to show one more thing.

### 6) <code>if-elif-...-elif-else</code>
> It allows us to create condition block with more different possibilities

```
if 2 > 2:
  print("This is true!")
elif 2 == 2:
  print("They are equal")
.
.
.
elif 2 != 2:
  print("They aren't equal")
else:
  print("This isn't true!")
```

<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <p>This will write <i>They aren't equal</i> because <i>if-second elif</i> condition isn't right and <i>first elif</i> is right. We used "!=" in our "elif" section. As the other example, we can check some conditions. These "==" and "!=" some examples of what we use. Until now, you learned the print something to the screen, you learned to use input and you see the if-elif-else condition blocks. To learn and understand these blocks too, we need to learn something more 😄</p>
</details>

## 📜 Data Types
> In this sections, you will see explanations about data types. Thus you will understand variables and data types. After this sections, you will see explanations about variables. Shortly, we use them to store or use datas in our program or code. 

### 1) <code>str</code>
> This data type is using for string datas. For example, if you want to add your name or any kind of string data your variable will be <code>str</code> data.
>> <code>"Earth"</code> is a string(str) data.

### 2) <code>int</code>
> This data type is using for integer datas. For example, if you want to use your age in your program it will be <code>int</code> data.
>> <code>13</code> is a integer(int) data.

### 3) <code>float</code>
> This data type is using for decimal number datas. For example, if you want to use temperature in your program this data will be <code>float</code>.
>> <code>303.1</code> is a float data.

### 4) <code>bool</code>
> This data type is using for understanding something is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. We generally use them with loops.

### 5) <code>list</code>
> This data type is using for collecting datas under a list. You can think it like your "shopping list", that's mean your "shopping list" is a <code>list</code> data. In python we use "\[" and "\]" for define them.
>> <code>["book","cd","food","water"]</code>

### ⭐) Comment Line
> If you want to add line which won't use by program, you can write them with "#". It's name is comment line because developers use them for adding note their programs. But if your comment will be longer than 4-5 lines you have another option to make them comment line, It's "```" "```" . Let's look at the example below.

```# This is a comment line in Python# These lines won't run by your compiler (VSCode)
  print("Where I am?") # This is comment line too but if I do like this, my print command will work but as the other this part won't run by program
‎```And this is the comment block in PythonYou can write a lot of lines into this‎```
```

## 🎨 Variables
> As I told before, we use variables to store or use datas in our program or code. Let's see how we use them. 

### 1) The Variables We Set
> We can define variables when we write the code.

```
name = "Apple"                       # str (String)
myNumber = 5                         # int (Integer)
your_ number = 0.2                   # float (Float)
ourList = ["apple","orange","grape"] # list (List)
``` 

### 2) The Variables Receiving Data From User
> We don't have to define variable with their values. Let's get values from user.

```
name = input("What is your name? >")
``` 
<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <p>But there is a difference. If user write there <code>6</code>, this data won't be string. Until you write an answer to your <code>input</code> command, "name" will be "NoneType". You can think that's undefinied. But when you write and hit the enter, it will be changed.</p>
</details>

### 3) Using Datas From User
> We can use data came from user. In this example we will use <code>f</code> string. We can use our variables in the texts we wrote with this string type. Looks like that <code>print(f"{variable_name}")</code>

```
name = input("What is your name? >")

print(f"My name is {name}") # Output will be "My name is (your input)" 
``` 
<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <p>If you want to print your name here, you have to write your variable which gets your name.</p>
</details>

### ⭐) Print Data
> We can print our datas by their variable.

```
myName = "Apple"
yourName = input("What is your name? > ")
  
print(myName)    # Apple writes. 
print(yourName)  # It will write your input
``` 

## ➕ Operations
> In this sections, you will see some common operations but they won't be all of them. For more look at the table and go for full document.

### 1) <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>
> We use these operator for check the values or datas are equal or not and returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Let's learn with the examples. In this example I will use with print but of course, you can use different ways.

  ```
x = 5
y = 10
print(x == y) # Prints "False" (== -> Are they equal?)
print(x != y) # Prints "True"  (!= -> Are they not equal?)
  ```

### 2) <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>*</code>
> We use these operator for basic mathematical calculations.

  ```
x = 47
y = 38
print(x + y) # Prints "85"
print(x - y) # Prints "9"
print(x / y) # Prints "1.236842105263158"
print(x * y) # Prints "1786"
  ```

### 3) <code><</code>, <code>></code>
> We use these to returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. They control the values like <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>.
  
  ```
x = 50
y = 30
print(x > y) # Prints "True"
print(x < y) # Prints "False"
  ```

### 4) <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>
> We use these operator for creating more complex conditions.

  ```
x = 50
y = 30
print(x > y and x == 50) # Prints "True". Because x > y is true and x == 50 returns true too. Then the result is true.
print(x < y or y == 30) # Prints "True". Because y = 30. In "or" operation, just one true enough for returning true.
  ```
<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <code>print(x > y and x == 50) # Prints "True". Because x > y is true and x == 50 returns true too. Then the result is true.
print(x < y or y == 30) # Prints "True". Because y = 30. In "or" operation, just one true enough for returning true.</code>

# ➰ Loops
> In this section, we will learn about loops. After this section, you will be ready for examples and more!

### 1) <code>For</code> Loops with Lists
> It's our the first loop type.

```
# for {variable name for each element} in {element's resource}:
#   {we can do anything we want}

list = ["book","cd","food","water"]

for name in list:
  print(f"This is {name}")
```
<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <p>This loop will run the print command for four times because our list have four element and name variable will be write different for each tour.</p>
  <code>This is book
    This is cd
    This is food
    This is water</code>
</details>

### 2) While 
> It's our the second loop type.

```
  # while ({condition}): # if the condition returns "True", loop will start and 
  #   {we can do anything we want}
  
  a = 10
  
  while (a > 5):
    print(f"A euals {a}")
```  

<details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    <p>If you do like this, you code will run until you close it or forever :D To avoid this problems and handle the loops better we will learn these <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>.</p>
</details>

### <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>

```  
  a = 10
  b = 0
  
  while (a > 5):
    print(f"A euals {a}")
    
    b = b + 1       # b will increase one each tour
  
    if b == 5:
      break         # loop will end on this line
    else:
      continue      # loop will continue when the b isn't equal 5
  
  
  # In this loop, when the name equals to "food", loop will end
  
  list = ["book","cd","food","water"]

  for name in list:
    if name == "food":
      break
    else:
      continue
```  
  
# 🤸🏼‍♂️ Converting Data Types
> We will learn the data types and their conversions.

### 1) <code>type({variable_name})</code>
> This command helps us to understand the variables types. Let's see in an example.

```
name = "Alice"
age1 = "18"
age2 = 18
age3 = 18.5
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Larry"]
tutorial_is_good = True

print(type(name))               # name = "Alice"                    -> <class 'str'>
print(type(age1))               # age1 = "18"                       -> <class 'str'>
print(type(age2))               # age2 = 18                         -> <class 'int'>
print(type(age3))               # age3 = 18.5                       -> <class 'float'>
print(type(names))              # names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Larry"] -> <class 'list'>
print(type(tutorial_is_good))   # tutorial_is_good = True           -> <class 'bool'>
  
# Tip
print(name + age1)        # Works because we can collect str types
print(name + " " + age1)  # Works because we can collect str types
printf(name + age2)       # Doesn't Work we can't collect str and int types
print(name + " " + age2)  # Doesn't Work we can't collect str and int types
``` 

### 2) Converting the Data Types
  
  <code>str()
  int()
  float()
  bool()</code>
  
```
name = "Alice"
age1 = "18"
age2 = 18
age3 = 18.5
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Larry"]
tutorial_is_good = True
  
print(name + age1)        # Works because we can collect str types
print(name + " " + age1)  # Works because we can collect str types
printf(name + str(age2))       # Doesn't Work we made the age2's type str
print(name + " " + str(age2))  # Doesn't Work we made the age2's type str

  
a = "True"

print(type(a))
print(type(bool(a)))
```
